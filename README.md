# -S-P-500-stock-prediction-using-Random-Forest-and-LSTM-Machine-Learning-Models
Dataset preparation, Data pre-processing and Feature engineering techniques were implemented using Pandas library.Features were analysed using Visualization techniques and ML models such as Random forests and LSTM's were chosen to compare the prediction results and the model was tuned for better prediction.
